Detail Project Overview and Workflow: 
KPN Optical Networking is the latest Fiber optics /Voip technology Provider in Netherland. It will enable a  host  of  rich multimedia services  such  as  video  calling,  video  on  demand,  and provide a richer experience for existing services such as  mobile  internet, mobile TV and MMS, Broadband , Fiber optics technology Nextgen Networks operate on technology called High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSPA). Data is transmitted many times faster than earlier 5G networks. This basically means that in addition to the earlier audio, graphics, and text, you can now send and receive video content too.
Ethernet is widely applied as carrier-class access technology. With the addition of IP and tunneling capabilities to packet edge devices, a variety of new business services can be offered. Our FSP 150 packet edge and aggregation transport solution enables you to deliver MEF-certified Carrier Ethernet services and IP connectivity with carrier-class performance, 100G scalability and highest security in a most resilient way. Whether you’re offering mobile backhaul, business services, or wholesale access, our FSP 150 family is the market’s first ubiquitous metro access platform that enables profitable and differentiated connectivity services scaling from Mbit/s to 100Gbit/s. Designed for demarcation, aggregation and hosting of software appliances, our solution is optimized for cost-efficient transport over fiber, copper and TDM networks
This project deals with 2 application.
a .NPCP – Network Planning Configuration Platform
b. ESRP –Exchange server Records Platform
End user should able to add and delete the shelf, Rack and cards from Exchange Data (ESRP). In the meantime ESRP Generate request XML and send to NPCP. NPCP execute the request XML and revert to ESRP with Response XML. When user operate any changes in ESRP component then same reflects in NPCP component.
